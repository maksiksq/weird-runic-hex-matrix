# official todo
- [x] finish the thing
- [x] BUG: (BAND AID filling it with white)Fix browser-only clear bug (library/canvas bug???)
- [ ] BUG: Going from windowed to docked requires canvas restart // note: if you resize the window manually a lil and then go docked, it works like intended
- [ ] BUG: sending transparency data through ble, could resize payload size by like 25%
- [x] BUG: (this was not minor at all): ESP32 struggles to process first image if it's just been powered on (whatever sorta)
- [ ] BUG: make image canvas an drawing canvas work together somehow
- [ ] Add more functionality for drawing (size change in particular)
- [x] Real time // tomorrow me, you can probably send the image order alongside the image itself
- [x] (Won't do, no library, too much pain, ble is fine)Maybe wi-fi?
- [ ] FreeRTOS parallelization for actually optimal performance??
- [ ] Bottom which i band aided with white looks a tad sharper whatever
