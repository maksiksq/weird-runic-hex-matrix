# official todo
- [ ] finish the thing
- [ ] BUG: Fix browser-only clear bug (library/canvas bug???)
- [ ] BUG: Going from windowed to docked requires canvas restart // note: if you resize the window manually a lil and then go docked, it works like intended
- [ ] BUG: sending transparency data through ble, could resize payload size by like 25%
- [ ] BUG: (minor): ESP32 struggles to process first image if it's just been powered on (whatever sorta)
- [ ] BUG: make image canvas an drawing canvas work together somehow
- [ ] Add more functionality for drawing (size change in particular)
- [ ] Real time // tomorrow me, you can probably send the image order alongside the image itself
- [ ] Maybe wi-fi?
- [ ] FreeRTOS parallelization for actually optimal performance??
